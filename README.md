Predicting Batting order of Red Sox against Yankees using Bayesian Inference

Problem Statement:
    The Red Sox are in panic mode, and they just hired you for a million dollar salary to build
    data analytics for them to predict best possible batting order to beat the Yankees.Build the 
    most appropriate model and predict the batting ranks of Red Sox. 
    
Approach:
   The prediction of the Batting order of Red Sox players is done using Bayesian Inference where priors are set initally and batting order 
   is formed.
   The posterior check is done on the predicted model and it was found that the prediciton was not accuracte becuase of which we changed 
   the batting order.
